# abc-collection

Various collections of abc files of mostly English, Irish and Scottish folk music.

This collection is for my personal use, but as it grows, others might find this format (ie. a git repository) useful too.

I claim no copyright over the individual files (see individual files for any information), and put database rights into the public domain:

----------------
To the extent possible under law, Andrew Wigglesworth has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to abc-collection. This work is published from: United Kingdom.
